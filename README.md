# Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed for freelance web developers or anyone who needs a simple yet efficient way to generate logos for their projects without relying on graphic designers. With this tool, users can quickly create custom SVG logos by providing text, choosing colors for the text and shapes, selecting a shape from a predefined list (circle, triangle, or square), and saving the generated logo as an SVG file.

**Key Features:**

- **User-friendly Interface:** The application utilizes the Inquirer package to provide a user-friendly interface with prompts for text input, color selection, and shape choices.

- **Custom Text:** Users can enter up to three characters of text to be displayed in the logo, allowing for personalized branding.

- **Color Customization:** Users can select colors for both the text and the chosen shape either by entering color keywords or hexadecimal numbers, providing flexibility in design.

- **Shape Selection:** The application offers a list of predefined shapes (circle, triangle, and square) for users to choose from, enabling them to tailor the logo to their preferences.

- **SVG Output:** Upon entering all necessary input, the application generates an SVG file named `logo.svg`, containing the specified text, colors, and shape, meeting the requirements of scalability and high-quality rendering.

**Technical Details:**

The SVG Logo Maker is built using Node.js and leverages Jest for unit testing to ensure robustness and reliability. The core functionality is implemented through classes such as `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square`, with inheritance used to manage common properties and methods efficiently. Additionally, the application follows best practices for file structure, naming conventions, and code quality, promoting maintainability and readability.

## Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

**Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure Node.js and npm (or yarn) are installed on your system. Verify by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.

To install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), you can follow these steps:

#### For Windows:

1. **Download Node.js Installer:**
   Go to the official Node.js website at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), and download the Windows installer (`.msi` file) for the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on the downloaded file to run it.

3. **Follow Installation Steps:**
   Follow the prompts in the Node.js Setup Wizard. Accept the license agreement, choose the installation location, and click "Next" to proceed.

4. **Complete Installation:**
   Click "Install" to begin the installation. Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to close the setup wizard.

5. **Verify Installation:**
   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and type the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

#### For macOS:

1. **Install Node.js Using Homebrew:**
   If you have Homebrew installed, you can use it to install Node.js and npm by running the following command in Terminal:
   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are installed by typing the following commands in Terminal:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

#### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. **Install Node.js Using Package Manager:**
   You can install Node.js and npm using the package manager (apt) by running the following commands in Terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are installed by typing the following commands in Terminal:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

Once Node.js and npm are successfully installed, you can proceed with using them to develop and run your applications.

### 2. Get the Code

Clone or download the [repository](https://github.com/ngojohn2002/10-OOP-SVG-Logo-Maker) containing the SVG Logo Maker code to your local machine by navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
